# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js `Link` component where clicking the link does not navigate to the intended route.  The problem might stem from incorrect usage, missing configuration, or conflicting code.

## Problem Description
The provided `bug.js` shows a basic implementation of the Next.js `Link` component linking to a route named `/about`.  Despite the route being correctly defined, clicking the link may not result in navigation or might produce a 404 error.

## Solution
The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses potential reasons why the `Link` component is failing to work properly, including:

* **Incorrect path:** Double-check that the `href` prop matches the defined route exactly (case-sensitive).
* **Missing `pages/about.js`:** Ensure that the corresponding page file exists in your `pages` directory.
* **Client-side routing issues:** If using client-side routing, ensure it's correctly configured in `next.config.js`.
* **Conflicting JavaScript:**  Other JavaScript code could interfere with the link's functionality.

This repository aims to illustrate this frequent issue and demonstrate how to resolve it, improving understanding and helping avoid similar problems in Next.js projects.
